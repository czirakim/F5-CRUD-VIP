# F5-CRUD-VIP

This project is about using python to Create/Read/Update/Delete a F5 VIP (Virtua Server).
<br>There is a py script for each of these actions.
<br>Also I've tried also to represent the vips in graphical mode using pyvis library.
<br>The data used for configuring the pools/vips, are kept in json files.

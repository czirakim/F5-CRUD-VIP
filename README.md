# F5-CRUD-VIP

This project is about using python to Create/Read/Update/Delete a F5 VIP (Virtual Server).
<br>There is a py script for each of these actions.
<br>The data used for configuring the pools/profiles/irules/vips, is kept in JSON files in a separate folder for each service.
<br>Dockerfile is for creating the Jenkins container.
<br>Jenkinsfile's are for creating pipelines.
<br>I've tried also to represent the vips in graphical mode using pyvis library.
<br>You can find more in this article: https://latebits.com/2023/02/20/create-modify-delete-an-f5-virtual-server-using-python-and-jenkins-pipelines/
